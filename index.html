                            <p>
                                I'm a web developer with prior experience in mathematics, music, and education. I love the orderliness of computer code and see solid logic in its progression. I recently completed a successful internship program at Riafox Inc. in Boise, Idaho, where I gained solid experience in front-end design and styling
                                methodologies and was able to learn new platforms and languages to expand skillset. I also
                                received training in scrum processes, content management systems, and the process of growth-driven
                                design.</p>
                            <p>
                                My degree is in music, my first love, while my previous professional experience is in teaching higher-level mathematics in a high-needs rural school district. It wasn't until after college I investigated programming and decided to pursue this course.</p>
                            <p>
                                I received my programming training through the Full Stack Web Developer course at Boise CodeWorks, successfully passing their
                                Fall 2016 cohort.</p>

                            <p>
                                Many aspects of my life and career before becoming a programmer inform my current style and outlook. As a musician, I was
                                encouraged to record my practice for self-evaluation, and play for family and friends to
                                rehearse in performance settings. Today, this means that I still get family and friends to
                                examine my work, and I do my best to evaluate my design through the eyes of a user or other
                                observer. My biggest question is, "Would I want to use this?"</p>
                            <p>
                                As a trigonometry teacher, I was given the latitude to design my own curriculum. I had the responsibility to help my group
                                of seniors become college-ready before graduation. My approach involved finding and addressing
                                holes in their knowledge and prioritizing ways to work the specific practice they needed
                                into my daily instruction. I had to skip areas that I considered engaging, like polyhedral
                                geometry, in order to concentrate on those I anticipated being most in need of in college
                                and beyond, such as exponential growth and interest rates. The lesson I have taken from this
                                experience is that necessary components must be added to a project before the flashier, bonus
                                features.

                    <h2>My Work Philosophy</h2>
                    <p>
                        Many aspects of my life and career before becoming a programmer inform my current style and outlook. As a musician, I was
                        encouraged to record my practice for self-evaluation, and play for family and friends to rehearse
                        in performance settings. Today, this means that I still get family and friends to examine my work,
                        and I do my best to evaluate my design through the eyes of a user or other observer. My biggest question
                        is, "Would I want to use this?"</p>
                    <p>
                        As a trigonometry teacher, I was given the latitude to design my own curriculum. I had the responsibility to help my group
                        of seniors become college-ready before graduation. My approach involved finding and addressing holes
                        in their knowledge and prioritizing ways to work the specific practice they needed into my daily
                        instruction. I had to skip areas that I considered engaging, like polyhedral geometry, in order to
                        concentrate on those I anticipated being most in need of in college and beyond, such as exponential
                        growth and interest rates. The lesson I have taken from this experience is that necessary components
                        must be added to a project before the flashier, bonus features.</p>
