                            <p>
                                I'm a web developer with prior experience in mathematics, music, and education. I love the orderliness of computer code and see solid logic in its progression. I recently completed a successful internship program at Riafox Inc. in Boise, Idaho, where I gained solid experience in front-end design and styling
                                methodologies and was able to learn new platforms and languages to expand skillset. I also
                                received training in scrum processes, content management systems, and the process of growth-driven
                                design.</p>
                            <p>
                                My degree is in music, my first love, while my previous professional experience is in teaching higher-level mathematics in a high-needs rural school district. It wasn't until after college I investigated programming and decided to pursue this course.</p>

                            <p>
                                The biggest question in my mind when I am evaluating my own work is, “Would I want to use this?”  After a program is working properly, I try to evaluate it through the eyes of a user.  I get family and friends to look at it.  I have a lot of practice at this process because of my musical training.  I was constantly recording myself and playing for others to get their opinions.  It was only through critically examining my own work through a lens outside myself that I was able to fine-tune and make real progress.</p>
                            <p>
                                I subscribe to the methodology of Growth-Driven Design.  What can I create first, that will have the most impact?  Generally about 80% of the impact can be created by judiciously selecting 20% of the project’s features and beginning development there.  I learned this lesson quickly when I was a high school trigonometry teacher with the latitude to design my own curriculum.  I had to skip many of my favorite topics in order to fulfill the need to get my students college-ready.  It was more important for them to understand interest rates than to explore 3-dimensional geometry.  This development of curriculum gave me the skills of project triage I still use when developing applications.

                    <h2>My Work Philosophy</h2>
                    <p>
                        The biggest question in my mind when I am evaluating my own work is, “Would I want to use this?”  After a program is working properly, I try to evaluate it through the eyes of a user.  I get family and friends to look at it.  I have a lot of practice at this process because of my musical training.  I was constantly recording myself and playing for others to get their opinions.  It was only through critically examining my own work through a lens outside myself that I was able to fine-tune and make real progress.</p>
                    <p>
                        I subscribe to the methodology of Growth-Driven Design.  What can I create first, that will have the most impact?  Generally about 80% of the impact can be created by judiciously selecting 20% of the project’s features and beginning development there.  I learned this lesson quickly when I was a high school trigonometry teacher with the latitude to design my own curriculum.  I had to skip many of my favorite topics in order to fulfill the need to get my students college-ready.  It was more important for them to understand interest rates than to explore 3-dimensional geometry.  This development of curriculum gave me the skills of project triage I still use when developing applications.</p>
