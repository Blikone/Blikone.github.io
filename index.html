                    <h3>About Me</h3>
                    <p>
                        I'm a thirty-year old web developer. I love the orderliness of computer code and see solid logic in its progression. By training
                        I'm a mathematician and a musician. My degree is in music and I have experience teaching higher-level
                        maths professionally. It wasn't until after college I investigated programming and decided to pursue
                        this course.</p>
                    <p>
                        I received my programming training through the Full Stack Web Developer course at Boise CodeWorks, successfully passing
                        their Fall 2016 cohort.</p>

                    <h3>My Experience</h3>
                    <p>
                        Many aspects of my life and career before becoming a programmer inform my current style and outlook. As a musician, I was
                        encouraged to record my practice for self-evaluation, and play for family and friends to rehearse
                        in performance settings. Today, this means that I still get family and friends to examine my work,
                        and I do my best to evaluate my design through the eyes of a user or other observer. My biggest question
                        is, "Would I want to use this?"</p>
                    <p>
                        As a trigonometry teacher, I was given the latitude to design my own curriculum. I had the responsibility to help my group
                        of seniors become college-ready before graduation. My approach involved finding and addressing holes
                        in their knowledge and prioritizing ways to work the specific practice they needed into my daily
                        instruction. I had to skip areas that I considered engaging, like polyhedral geometry, in order to
                        concentrate on those I anticipated being most in need of in college and beyond, such as exponential
                        growth and interest rates. The lesson I have taken from this experience is that necessary components
                        must be added to a project before the flashier, bonus features.</p>
